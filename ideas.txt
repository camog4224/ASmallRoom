have an option for the player, they can either continue to expand
a village until they have villages spanning across the continent
without any cohesive unity but with acenstry back to 1 place and
an overall greater appreciation for nature and each other,

or the player can choose to form a more cohesive and dense soceity
going from villages to towns, to cities, to a nation, to an empire

in the end, either way the soceity will lead into a roadblock,
which is, a god will aproach them, their gods antithesis, meaning
if they went nature, they are met with the tech god, and if they
go tech, they are met with the nature gods

in both routes, they can either turn a new leaf as a society
and coincide with the god that apears, or they can stick to
what they have been doing and go against that gods

if you choose to go against the god, then you have to race
to see if your soceity can progress enough to call upon the
god that coicides with what you are doing already before
the opposite god can stop you

if you choose not to go against the god then you can progress
to the other side of the stage with bonuses, like if you were
nature but turned tech, you have a high happiness in your people,
or if you go from tech to nature then you have a greater livespan
